<p>The philosophy of the Stoney tribe is to live in harmony with nature. If you destroy nature or the environment, you are ultimately destroying yourself. This is why at the heart of the differences between First Nations and the settlers, was the differing perspectives on the meaning of land.</p><p>&quot;The sacred waters, the hot springs that we used for healing and cleansing, were to become tourist resorts; our sacred mountains were to become ski areas and parks where we no longer have the right to pursue our religious practice!&quot; (Snow, John, pg 77).</p><p>Currently, Abraham Lake has a length of 32km, a maximum width of 3km, and a surface area of over 80&#39;000 acres, which amounts to over 120 sections of land.</p><p>Although the lake was proposed to be a great place for recreation, in 1970 a survey was carried out which determined that due to its length and shallowness, that it was far too dangerous to swim or sail in, thus ruining its potential for recreation. When the reservoir is low, the lake reveals gravel terraces which make walking along them difficult and hot. The silt and debris in the waters also discourage any swimming.</p><p>However, the lake is gorgeous in the winter, where the methane bubbles from the still-decomposing organisms underneath the lake become frozen in ice, which attracts a lot of tourism.</p><p>The lake was named after a Stoney named Silas Abraham, and his family, who had lived near the north Saskatchewan River for centuries. &quot;The impounded waters form an artificial lake named Powell, supposedly to honor but actually to dishonor the memory, spirit, and vision of Major John Wesley Powell, first American to make a systematic exploration of the Colorado River and its environs. Where he and his brave men once lined the rapids and glided through silent canyons two thousand feet deep the motorboats now smoke and whine, scumming the water with cigarette butts, beer cans and oil, dragging the water skiers on their rounds, clockwise.&quot; (Abbey, Edward, pg 152). This quote from Abbey&#39;s book, although very brusque, does strike a tone of similarity between his description of Lake Powell, and our Abraham Lake. The creation of the bighorn Dam and resulting reservoir of water destroyed many features associated with this family, including Silas Abraham&#39;s birth place at Abraham Flats, where he and his son Norman also created and lived in cabins. The name was given to honour this family and what it stood for, but unfortunately the lake itself also embodies the destruction of lifestyle for the Stoneys in the Kootenay Plains, as well as the nature they lived alongside.</p>
