<p>The Kootenay Plains are characterized by many open forests and grasslands caused by low rainfall and a common occurrence of chinooks. It is also the warmest and driest region of the Rockies. This mild climate is what made this area critical for many animals during the winter, including elk, mule deer, mountain sheep and moose. Currently, over 60 species of birds, 14 mammals, and over 240 species of vascular plants live here. Many of the 240 species of plants are also uncommon in Alberta.</p><p>The Kootenay Plains were previously named Cottonahow Plain, and the Stoney name for this area is Kadoona Tinda, meaning &quot;Windy Plains&quot;. The word Kootenay is an anglicized form of the Kootenay word &quot;Ktunaxa&quot;, which may be a dialectic version of &quot;tunaxa&quot;, which was the name for the Kootenays who inhabited the Kootenay Plains prior to the 19th century. Around 1810, the Peigen people drove the Kootenays out towards the West side of the Rockies using their superior weapons, and in their place the Mountain Cree and Stoneys took their place. These two nations served as middlemen in the fur trade between the Kootenays and the Rocky Mountain trading post.</p><p>When the Bighorn Dam was created it flooded most of the land which the Stoneys still lay claim to, which included cabins, graves, campgrounds, and pastures. The Stoneys asked for compensation, which included reserve land on what remained of the Kootenay Plains. In 1974, the federal government agreed to give them more land but the provincial government refused, and so to this day no Bighorn-Kootenay band member owns any land in the Kootenay Plains. </p><p>Currently, 95% of the people living in the Bighorn Reserve are on welfare since the loss of hunting and the plains from the creation of Abraham Lake made them lose their way of life, and have been unable to transition to a different trade or lifestyle. The Kootenay Plains, which used to represent a &quot;paradise&quot; for wildlife, now has diminished in exchange for the land which Abraham Lake now covers.</p>
