<p>&quot;The magnificent view from Windy Point is likely to become even more exciting when looking over the man-made lake at full supply&quot; (Ross, Jane, pg 62). This is quoted from a reporter in 1970 on the recreational potential of the lake.</p><p>Windy Point is a highly valued place to the Stoneys, and the flooding of the Kootenay Plains impacted it in a crucial manner.</p><p>The main problem with the creation of the reservoir was the risk of flooding Stoney graves at Windy Point, which were placed near the water. Many First Nations have a close connection between bodies of water and the dead. When a member passed away, they were buried at the confluence of a body of water and a stream, one of which represented life and the other death. Their spirits would then be carried by both bodies of water into the afterlife. This is why many First Nations have a fear of dying away from water.</p><p>Thus, with the threat of having their gravesite destroyed due to flooding, they were faced with a choice of either leaving the graves, or moving them to a safer location. Some graves ended up being moved but many stayed, and are currently underneath Abraham Lake. Some of these graves contain members of the Abraham family, which the lake is named after.</p><p>Windy Point currently serves as a tourist area, where people who are driving down the Thompson Highway stop to come down and look at Abraham Lake. This is a sharp contrast to what it used to be; a place where families would buries their loved ones, at the junction between the paths of life and death.</p>
