<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Abraham Lake is something i&#39;ve driven by often on my way to the Rocky Mountains. Every time, like any tourist, I would stop and take pictures of the scenery, and marvel at its beauty. That was the Lake&#39;s meaning to me; a beautiful artificial reservoir, which was special due to how the methane bubbles rising from its depth would freeze during the winter, forming countless frozen bubbles right underneath the ice. Even Wikipedia, summarizes this lake in a very similar fashion, only to add that it was named after Silas Abraham.</p><p>During a backpacking course I was able to learn more about the lake, and its controversial past. This intrigued me, however my attempts at finding more information using Google, Wikipedia, and the university&#39;s library resulted in nothing. Clearly there was an interesting story behind this area, but no one had provided any information beyond its famous beauty.</p><p>Later on I elected to take a course on Storied Landscapes, which explored how places were connected to stories, and the meaning that we placed on them beyond their physical appearance. Having contacted the person who had provided information on Abraham Lake I found the relevant information and sources via a hiking guide, such as the meaning behind names, and stories of the various places surrounding Abraham Lake.</p><p>How had Bighorn Dam, which created Abraham Lake, changed what the surrounding area meant to me and other people? Edward Abbey&#39;s recounting of his view of Lake Powell in <em>Desert Solitaire: A Season In the Wilderness</em> was especially relatable, and served as this project&#39;s spearhead. This project aims to be a source of information on the stories behind Bighorn Dam and Abraham Lake, and to also explore how changes in the landscape not only change its physical appearance, but also the stories and meaning which are contained within it.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><p>The web-app is organized twofold: The first is via the toggle in the top-left corner, which serves to transition the map before and after Bighorn Dam was built, to better contrast its impact on the landscape. The second is via the cards hovering above the map, which you may move your mouse over to gain a magnified view of the summary of its contents. If the contents intrigue you, you may click on them to obtain more information. Once you are done, you may click on the &quot;x&quot; in the top right corner.</p><p>This web-app was designed in order to be easily accessed from any device, whether it be a desktop browser, a phone, or even packaged as an application via <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>.</p>
