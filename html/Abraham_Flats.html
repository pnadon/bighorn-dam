<p>The Abraham Flats are located just outside of the Cline River at its confluence with the North Saskatchewan River. It was previously named Cataract Flats after the Cline River&#39;s previous name, Cataract River. </p><p>The Flats are also where Silas Abraham and his son, Norman, built cabins to live in, and also speculated to have been the place of birth for Silas Abraham in 1871.</p><p>Its current name, Abraham Flats, is one of the many places in the Rockies named after the Abraham family, who were incredibly important to both the Stoneys and the settlers in the area. Because of these contributions, Silas Abraham and his family are almost synonymous with the Kootenay Plains and area. Other areas named after the Abraham family include Mount Abraham, Abraham Lake, and Abraham Slabs. An interesting point to note is that all of these places were named by non-natives, since the First Nations people have a firm belief in not naming places after people. Although these areas were named after the Abrahams to honour them, one must ponder if the current state of these areas caused by the creation of the reservoir, truly represents what the Abrahams stood for. Today, the Abraham Flats are almost always underneath Abraham Lake, and only come into view when the water level is low.</p>
