<p>In 1969, John Snow, who became chief the same year, had heard rumours of plans to build a dam north of the Kootenay Plains. He assumed it was for a long term project, since the Stoneys still had claims on the area that had not been settled. What he didn&#39;t know is that Calgary Power and the Albertan government had already signed an agreement to begin construction of the dam, without first consulting the First Nations peoples of the area. Calgary Power predicted it could output around 108&#39;000 kW of hydroelectric power, and that the reservoir would provide many recreation opportunities. As we know from the Abraham Lake page, the reservoir ended up being too dangerous for recreation. The Albertan government stated it had given 2 weeks notice to the residents of the construction which would begin soon. However, for John Snow this came as a surprise:</p><p>“Before I discovered how far this had gone, work crews had moved in with heavy equipment and begun massive destruction of the beautiful North Saskatchewan Valley near the Bighorn Reserve. Wesley Band members from the reserve came to Morley Reserve and told [John Snow] of bulldozers knocking over [First Nations] log cabin, destroying [First Nations] graves, and ruining traplines as well as traditional hunting areas.” (Snow, John, pg 128).</p><p>After hearing of this, he went to see for himself and found the land which still had claims on it being bulldozed, including cabins and graves. He then had a meeting with the Wesley Band members, and came to an unanimous agreement to oppose the construction of the dam until the claims were settled. John Snow wrote a letter to Premier Strom, pointing out that the creation of the dam would bring harm to the following:</p><ul><li>Burial sites</li><li>Homes</li><li>Land</li><li>Hunting area</li><li>Grazing land for horses</li><li>Traplines</li><li>Sun Dance and Recreation Area</li><li>Historical / Cultural significance of the land</li><li>Disruption of way of life</li><li>Fear of living below the dam</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, the government &quot;turned a deaf ear&quot;, and the dam was built anyways.</p><p>With our constant need to improve and build upon our land, we often forget that by changing the landscape, we destroy the stories and meanings attached to them. The place-names, stories and meaning contained within the burial sites, hunting grounds, and homes around Windy Point, Abraham Flats, and the Kootenay Plains were exchanged for hydroelectric power, and we must remain aware of that fact.</p>
